### Loopidity Assets Licenses

The original audio, video, image and font files in the Loopidity assets/ directory are licensed under [version 3 of the GNU General Public License](COPYING.images).
With respects to the terminology in section 1 of the GPLv3 (namely: "sources", "preferred form", and "object code"),
the "object code" is explicitly defined here to be audio, video, image and font files accessed directly by the Loopidity program;
and the "source code" or "preferred form of the work" are explicitly defined here to be any and all
binary data, editor project files, meta-data, declarative texts, scripts, and source code of helpers
that are necessary to accomplish all of the following tasks using only widely-available free software:
* reconstruct the associated "object code" artifacts completely and accurately
* modify the fully decomposed "preferred form" sources directly and independently
* compose the original sources along with modified and replacement sources interchangeably
* generate equivalent modified versions of the associated artifacts

For example:
* "artifacts" such as a composed (mixed-down) .png, .svg, .wav, etc (these are typically all that is covered by Crerative Commons licenses)
* "binary data" such are the individual elements that compose the "artifacts" (image layers, sound tracks, etc.)
* "meta-data" and "declarative texts" such as 3D models, animations, edit decision lists/cue sheets, CSS, etc.
* "scripts", and "source code of helpers" such as ImageMagick scripts, GIMP plugins, openGL shaders, etc.
* "editor project files" such as .blend, .xcf, .psd, .aup, .ardour, etc.
* "widely-available free software" such as GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, Ardour, etc.

The binary "object code" files are located in the Loopidity assets/ directory
and the "source code" files are located in the Loopidity assets/sources/ directory.
