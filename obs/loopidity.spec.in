%description
  Loopidity is a native GNU/Linux and Windows application built with
  the SDL framework and using the JACK Connection Kit for audio I/O.
  Loopidity is designed so that the most useful functions can be controlled
  using as few buttons as possible (a small number of foot pedals for example).
  The Loopidity state graph is kept as small and linear as possible
  so that it can be easily memorized; as not to hinder the creative workflow,
  but to quickly become an intuitive activity.
